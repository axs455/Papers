\begin{abstract}
A computational approach based on a $k-\omega$ delayed detached eddy simulation
model for predicting aerodynamic loads on a smooth circular cylinder is
verified against experiments. Comparisons with experiments are performed for
flow over a stationary cylinder and for a cylinder oscillating in the
transverse direction due to flow-induced forces (vortex-induced vibration or
VIV). For the static cases, measurement data from the literature is used to
validate the predictions for normally-incident flow. New experiments are
conducted as a part of this study for yawed flow, where the cylinder axis is
inclined with respect to the inflow velocity at the desired yaw angle,
$\beta=30^\circ$. Good agreement is observed between the predictions and
measurements for mean and rms surface pressure and wake velocity deficit.
However the lift spectrum prediction shows a slight offset in frequency from
the measurements. Three yawed flow cases ($\beta=15^\circ, 30^\circ, \,\&\,
45^\circ$) are simulated and the results are found to be independent of $\beta$
(dynamic scaling) when the flow speed normal to the cylinder axis is selected
as the reference velocity scale.  

Dynamic (VIV) simulations are performed by coupling the flow solver with a
solid dynamics solver where the cylinder motion in the transverse direction is
modeled as a spring-mass-damper system. The simulations accurately predict the
displacement amplitude and unsteady loading over a wide range of reduced
velocity, including the region where lock-in occurs. VIV simulations are
performed at two yaw angles, $\beta=0^\circ$ and $45^\circ$ and the
appropriately-scaled results are found to be similar over the range of reduced
velocities tested with slightly higher discrepancy around the reduced velocity
corresponding to the natural frequency of the system.

%
A computational methodology based on a $k-\omega$ delayed detached eddy
simulation (DDES) model and in-house experiments are used to investigate
aerodynamic loading on a smooth circular cylinder. Simulations are performed
for the cylinder in normally-incident flow (static and dynamic) and yawed flow
(3 cases). The computational methodology for predicting aerodynamic loading on
the cylinder is verified against experimental data in normally-incident flow
($\beta=0^\circ$) and yawed flow ($\beta=30^\circ$). The agreement between the
simulations and the experiments for normally-incident flow is very good, and
the results of the yawed flow simulation with $\beta=30^\circ$ in reasonable
agreement with the experiment. Overall, these comparisons show that the
computational methodology is able to accurately predict aerodynamic loading on
a static, smooth circular cylinder in smooth inflow.

Comparisons of simulation results for different flow angles ($\beta$) show that
the aerodynamic loads do not vary with yaw angle when the loads and frequency
are non-dimensionalized using the component of the flow velocity normal to the
cylinder axis. This indifference to yaw angle, referred to as the independence
principle, is observed for yawed flow up to $45^\circ$.

The numerical study of VIV of an elastically-mounted cylinder in
normally-incident flow agrees well with Exp III, but show some differences with
Exp II. The difference might be caused by the end effects of the experiment.
Other than the upper branch, the numerical results for two different yawed flow
($\beta=0^\circ$ and $45^\circ$) show reasonable agreement, which indicates
independence principle is applicable for the most regime of VIV, except for the
upper branch.
