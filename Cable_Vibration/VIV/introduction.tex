Inclined and horizontally- or vertically-spanned cylinder are used in various
engineering applications: cable-stayed, suspension, and tied-arch bridges,
power transmission lines, offshore risers, sub-sea pipelines etc. These
cylinders are prone to large-amplitude flow-induced vibration, which can lead
to catastrophic failure of the cylinders and the structures supported by them.
The vibration mechanisms involve complex aeroelastic (motion-induced)
interactions that depend on the spatial orientation, geometry,
surface-characteristics, and dynamic properties of
cylinders. \cite{davenport1995dynamics} shows that large amplitude vibrations
can lead to either catastrophic- or fatigue failure of the cylinders and/or the
adjoining structures, which poses a significant threat to the safety and
serviceability of these systems.

Wind induced vibration can be classified into the following categories:
K\'arm\'an vortex-induced vibration (VIV), rain-wind induced vibration (RWIV),
wake-induced vibration, and dry- or iced-cable galloping. While VIV and RWIV
occur at relatively low wind speeds ($<20$ m/s), wake-induced vibration and or
dry-cable galloping occur at higher speeds. Simulation of any of these
aeroelastic phenomena requires accurate computation of the aerodynamic loads
acting on the cable.  This paper presents a comprehensive verification of a
high-fidelity flow simulation technique (detached eddy simulations or DES) for
flow over rigidly and elastically-mounted rigid circular cylinders in normal
and yawed flow. Yaw angle ($\beta$) is defined as the angle between the
cylinder axis and a vector orthogonal to the flow velocity vector in the plane
of the cylinder axis.  Yawed flow is considered because RWIV and dry-cable
galloping occur only when $\beta \ne 0$. The diameter-based Reynolds number in
the simulations is $Re_D=2\times 10^4$. At this $Re_D$, the boundary layer is
laminar when separation occurs and transition to turbulence takes place in the
free shear layer. The results of this paper are presented in two parts - the
first part deals with rigidly-mounted (static) cylinders and the second part
addresses elastically-mounted cylinders.

In the first part of the paper, simulations of flow over a static cylinder are
verified with measurements from the literature as well as new experiments that
are performed for $\beta=0^\circ$ and $30^\circ$ as a part of this study;
Simulations are performed for four values of $\beta$
($=0^\circ,~15^\circ,~30^\circ,$ and $45^\circ$) to investigate the effect of
yaw and to examine the validity of the {\em independence principle} (IP) which
states that the aerodynamic loads scaled using the velocity component normal to
the cylinder axis are independent of $\beta$ (\citet{zdravkovich2003flow}).
Prior research (see e.g., \citet{franzini2009experimental} and
\citet{zhao2009direct}) has suggested the validity of IP for $\beta$ up to
$45^\circ$. Comparisons between the simulations and measurements include mean
and rms of surface pressure, mean wake velocity profile, and power spectra of
lift and drag. The agreement with the measured data ranges from very good to
acceptable. The results of yawed flow simulations confirm the validity of IP
for the static configurations analyzed.

Vortex-induced vibrations are self-excited oscillations that occur due to the
unsteady lift generated on a cylinder as a result of the vortex shedding in its
wake. VIV is a very common occurrence in many engineering applications, e.g.,
offshore structures, transmission lines, stacks, and bridges. Of particular
interest is the phenomenon of ``lock-in'' or ``synchronization'' which occurs
when the vortex-shedding frequency gets locked in with the natural frequency of
the system. High but finite-amplitude (limit-cycle) oscillations are observed
in this resonance condition due to nonlinearity in the system. These
high-amplitude oscillations can cause significant damage to the structure. VIV
has been investigated extensively in the past few decades due to its practical
significance. \cite{bearman1984vortex},~\cite{sarpkaya2004critical} and
\cite{williamson2004vortex} present detailed reviews of the research on this
topic.

Investigations of VIV over the past several decades, have resulted in an
improved understanding of the phenomenon. Until recently, most of these
investigations considered relatively high mass and damping systems. In the last
two decades, VIV of low mass and damping systems has garnered considerable
interest due to the applicability of the phenomenon in marine engineering and
offshore wind turbines (mooring lines). Such low mass-damping systems have been
largely investigated using experiments (e.g., \citet{jain2013vortex} and
\citet{franzini2013one}) and semi-analytical methods that model vortex shedding
using the classical Van der Pol oscillator (e.g., ~\cite{xu2008high}). 

Experiments of VIV in low mass-damping systems have been typically conducted in
water channels with partially or fully-submerged cylinders. Such setup can
suffer from finite-span effects due to different end conditions on the two ends
-- wall on one side and free surface on the other. These effects are distinctly
observable in yawed flow measurements where the results are found to be
dependent on the direction with respect to the flow the cylinder is yawed
(i.e., $\beta=45^\circ$ versus $-45^\circ$). Simulations do not suffer from end
effects as periodic boundary conditions enable simulating an infinitely long
cylinder. 

Numerical computations of VIV of low mass-damping systems have been performed
using the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations (e.g.,
\citet{guilmineau2004numerical}), large eddy simulations or LES (e.g.,
\citet{al2004vortex}), and direct numerical simulations or DNS (e.g.,
\citet{lucor2005vortex}, \citet{evangelinos2000dns}, and \citet{dong2005dns}).
While the DNS approch is attractive from the perspective of resolving the
entire turbulence spectrum, it is only feasible for very low Reynolds number
($Re$) due to the associated computation cost. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is
more feasible at moderate $Re$ while Detached Eddy Simulations (DES) can be
used over a very large range of $Re$ without making the computations
prohibitively expensive. 

In the second part of this paper, the phenomenon of VIV is investigated with
elastically-mounted cylinder simulations and the results are verified against
measured data available in the literature. The VIV simulations are also
performed at multiple values of $\beta$ ($=0^\circ$ and $45^\circ$) to
investigate the validity of the independence principle for VIV of low
mass-damping systems.

With the detailed comparisons with measurements for rigid and
elastically-mounted oscillating cylinder presented here, this paper can serve
asa benchmark for the accurancy of the DES technique in predicting aerodynamic
loads on cables in static condition and in dynamic motion.
