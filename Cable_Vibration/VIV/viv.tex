\subsection{Vortex-Induced Vibration (VIV)}
\label{sec:VIV}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
A schematic of the computational setup for the vortex-induced vibration (VIV)
simulations is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:VIVmodel}. The setup is the same as
for the static simulations except for an additional forced mass-spring-damper
system. The cylinder is allowed to move only in the $y$ (cross-stream)
direction. The $y$ component of the integrated aerodynamic surface force on the
cylinder (denoted by $F_y$) drives the mass-spring-damper system given by
%
\begin{equation}
  m \frac{{\rm d}^2 y}{{\rm d}t^2} + c \frac{{\rm d} y}{{\rm d}t} + k y = F_y(t).
  \label{eq:mass-spring-damper}
\end{equation}
 
In the simulations the mass ratio $m^*=m/(\rho {\cal V})=2.6$, where $m$ is the
mass of the cylinder, ${\cal V}=\pi (D^2/4) . S$ is the volume of the cylinder,
$S$ is the cylinder span, and $\rho$ is the density of the fluid flowing over
the cylinder. The mechanical damping ratio of the system $\zeta = c/c_c$ is
$0.001$ where, $c_c=2\sqrt{k.m}$ is the critical damping, and the spring
stiffness $k$ is obtained from the natural frequency, $f_N$ as
$k=m(2\pi\,f_N)^2$.  The values of these parameters are selected to match the
measurements presented in~\cite{franzini2013one}.  This measurement dataset is
referred as Exp II in this paper. The predictions are also compared to another
dataset reported in~\cite{khalak1997fluid}, which is referred as Exp III here.
The mass ratio and damping ratio used in Exp III are slightly different
($m^*=2.4$ and $\zeta=0.0045$) from Exp II and the simulations. It should be
noted that the measurement results have end effects due to the finite length of
the cylinder. {\color{red} The experiments were conducted in water channels
\ldots check aspect ratio and differences between Exp II and III} The
simulations use periodic boundary conditions in the span direction, which
theoretically simulates an infinite span. However, span-periodicity can induce
artificial effects if the spanwise coherence is greater than the simulated
span.

Figure~\ref{fig:VIV_amp} compares the predicted non-dimensional
mean amplitude $\bar{A}/D$ with the measurements of Exp II and III over a wide
range of reduced velocity $V_{R,n}$, which is defined as
$V_{R,n}=V_n/(f_N\,D)$, where $f_N$ is the natural frequency of the system. The
subscript $n$ refers to the component of the vector normal to the cylinder axis
to accommmodate for yawed flow. Two different yaw angle flows are evaluated --
$\beta=0^\circ$ and $45^\circ$ -- both at $Re_{D,n}=20,000$. Reduced velocity
is the inverse of Strouhal number, $V_{R,n} = 1/St$.

\citet{khalak1997fluid} identified the following four distinct branches in
their VIV measurements for the zero-yaw case: the ``initial excitation''
branch, the ``upper'' branch, the ``lower'' branch, and the
``desynchronization'' branch. These are labeled and identified with solid black
lines as best curve fits of the measured data in Fig.~\ref{fig:VIV_amp} (a). In
the {\em initial excitation} branch, the mean amplitude grows rapidly with $V_{R,n}$.
The scaled displacement oscillation amplitude ($A/D$) reaches a peak in the
{\em upper} branch, drops to 60\% of the peak value in the {\em lower} branch, and then
finally drops to a negligible value at higher $V_{R,n}$ in the
{\em desynchronization} branch. The current DES simulations agree very well with the
data (particularly with Exp III) in the {\em initial excitation} and {\em upper} branches.
The peak amplitude is well captured and occurs around $V_{R,n}=4.76$, which
corresponds to the peak vortex shedding Strouhal number, $St=0.21$ for a
stationary cylinder. The predicted amplitude is slightly lower than the
measurements in the {\em lower} and {\em desynchronization} branches. Considering the
relatively large differences in the two sets of measurements (between Exp II
and Exp III), the prediction accuracy of the simulations is very good.

      shows the two setups (UP and DN) used in Exp II for yawed-flow
      measurements.} 
  \label{fig:VIV_amp}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:VIV_amp} (b) compares the predicted VIV amplitude with the
measurements from Exp II. The measurements were taken for two different
configurations of the cylinder, shown in the inset in the figure. Since the top
and bottom surfaces are not the same, the two configurations are not identical
and the measured data for the two configurations shows a large difference.
Since the setup in the experiment is asymmetric (wall at the bottom and free
surface on the top) and the fact that end plates were not used, end effects
(finite-span effect) might be the reason for the observed differences between
the two configurations. The predictions agree better with the ``Up''
configuration in the {\em initial excitation} and {\em upper} branches, and
with the ``Dn'' configuration in the {\em lower} branch. Exp II did not collect
any data at higher $V_{R,n}$ to test the prediction accuracy in the {\em
desynchronization} branch.

Figure~\ref{fig:VIV_yaw} investigates the effect of yaw angle on the amplitude
of VIV. The data from Exp II is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:VIV_yaw} (a) and the
DES predictions in Fig.~\ref{fig:VIV_yaw} (b). The DES predictions show little
difference between $\beta=0^\circ$ and $45^\circ$ except around $V_{R,n}=4$ and
$6$, where $A/D$ is highly sensitive to changes in $V_{R,n}$. As far as the
general variation of $A/D$ with $V_{R,n}$ (as shown in the plot with lines) is
considered, the DES predictions for both yaw angles show the same behavior,
suggesting that the independence principle also holds for VIV. From the
measurements however, one can only conclude that yaw-independence holds
primarily in the Initial Excitation branch. The large difference in the data
between the Up and Dn configurations for $\beta=45^\circ$ limits the
verification of yaw-independence in VIV predicted by DES to the {\em initial
excitation} branch.

    $\beta=0^\circ$ as a guide.}

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:VIV_freq} compares the normalized frequency ($f/f_N$) between
DES predictions and measurements from Exp III over a range of $V_{R,n}$. The
natural frequency, $f_N$ is determined from the mechanical properties (spring
and mass) of the cylinder system. The frequency $f$ is determined using the
peak transverse unsteady loading on the cylinder ($F_y$) in the simulations,
but in the experiments, it is determined using the transverse displacement of
the cylinder. The dynamical system of the cylinder is driven by $F_y$ and the
peak frequency corresponding to $F_y$ is selected to be $f$ for DES. This
information is not available for the measurements, and hence the frequency
corresponding to peak displacement is selected as $f_N$. The purple dashed line
corresponds to the vortex shedding frequency for a static cylinder
($St_p=0.21$), and the horizontal black dashed line presents the natural
frequency ($f=f_N$). The simulations capture the peak frequency well in all the
branches.

In the {\em initial excitation} branch, the cylinder oscillates at the driving
frequency ($f$) and $f/f_N$ increases linearly with the reduced velocity
$V_{R,n}$. Beyond resonance, which occurs at $f=f_N$, the oscillating frequency
is ``locked-in'' with the natural frequency of the system. This occurs in the
{\em upper} and {\em lower} branches identified in Fig.~\ref{fig:VIV_amp}. A
strict lock-in would imply $f/f_N=1$ for the range of $V_{R,n}$ during which
the system is locked in. However, for a low mass-damping system such as the one
considered here, the lock-in frequency is higher than the natural frequency,
i.e., $f/f_N>1$. As $V_{R,n}$ increases beyond lock-in, the system again starts
oscillating at the driving frequency and $f/f_N$ follows the purple line in the
figure. Figure~\ref{fig:VIV_freq} also plots the simulation results for
$\beta=45^\circ$, which are consistent with the results for $\beta=0^\circ$,
further confirming yaw-independence in the predictions.

As seen in Figs.~\ref{fig:VIV_amp} and~\ref{fig:VIV_yaw}, the amplitude jumps
up from the {\em initial excitation} branch to the {\em upper} branch, and
jumps down from the {\em upper} branch to the {\em lower} branch as $V_{R,n}$
is increased. These jumps occur as the mode in which the vortex shedding occurs
switches between two possible configurations. These are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:VIV_Q} using iso-surface of the Q-criterion as well using
schematics. In the `2S mode', two single vortices shed alternately from either
side of the cylinder in one cycle of cylinder motion, while in the `2P mode',
two pairs of vortices are shed from each side of the cylinder in one cycle.
Such 2P mode was observed in the smoke visualizations
of~\cite{brika1993vortex}. In the {\em initial excitation} branch, vortex
shedding occurs in the 2S mode, while in the {\em lower} branch, it switches to
the 2P mode.  In the {\em upper} branch of the lock-in regime, the vortex
shedding switches between the 2S and 2P modes. Other modes can also be observed
(e.g., 2P+S and P+S modes) in forced vibration motion.

%The force coefficients are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:force_VIV}. It is well known
%that the vibration motion can significantly increase the fluctuation of forces.
%Mean transverse force coefficient $\bar{C}_{x,n}$ for reduce velocities
%$V_{R,N} < 5.9$ have a very similar curve as mean amplitude $\bar{A}/D$ in
%Fig.~\ref{fig:VIV_amp}. However, mean amplitude $\bar{A}/D$ is almost constant
%in the {\em lower} branch while $\bar{C}_{x,n}$ continuously declines. The predicted
%rms of longitudinal force coefficients $C_{y,n,rms}$ has very sharp peak at
%$V_{R,n}=4$, which is slightly different from Exp. II. Similar to $\bar{A}/D$
%at $V_{R,n}=4$, $C_{y,n,rms}$ for $\beta=45^\circ$ is much larger than
%$\beta=0^\circ$. Overall, two yawed angle flow simulations have very similar
%results for small amplitude vibrations. Independent principle can be applied to
%forces coefficients except for the {\em upper} branch ($4 \leqslant V_{R,n}\leqslant
%5.9$).
