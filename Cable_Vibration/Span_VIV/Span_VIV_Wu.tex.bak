\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
Vortex-induced vibration (VIV) is commonly observed in bridge decks, cables,
power conductors, risers in oil rigs, etc. The K\'arm\'an vortex shedding in
the wake of a bluff body causes periodic forcing on the body. In certain
conditions the vortex-shedding frequency synchronizes (``lock-in'') with the
natural frequency of the system which results in high-amplitude oscillations
limited only by the system damping. Experimental investigations of VIV are
typically performed with finite-span cylinders with aspect ratios of around
$10$ to minimize ``end effects''(e.g,~\citet{govardhan2004critical}), where
``end-effects'' refers to effects due to three-dimensional flow at span ends. End
plates have been used in experiments (e.g., ~\citet{morse2008effect}), which
reduce but not completely eliminate the end effects.
%
%as horse-shoe vortices develop at the intersection of the cylinder and the end
%plates.

This problem is avoided in simulations by using periodic boundaries in the span
direction. While the periodic boundaries imply an infinitely-long cylinder, the
finite size of the computational domain in the span direction imposes
artificial periodicity in the flow. If spanwise variations are present in the
flow and the length scale of these variations is larger than the simulated
span, then span periodicity can yield incorrect results. For a turbulent flow,
this length scale can be measured using two-point correlations; in particular,
spanwise coherence. Magnitude-squared coherence is defined as 
%
$\gamma^2(\Delta z,f) = \langle \abs{S_{xy}(f)}^2 \rangle/(\langle
    S_{xx}(f)\rangle \langle S_{yy}(f) \rangle)$,
%
where $S_{xy}(f)$ denotes cross-spectral density of the desired quantity (e.g.,
sectional force) at points $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{y}$ separated by a distance
$\Delta z$ along the span, $S_{xx}(f)$ and $S_{yy}(f)$ are auto-spectral
densities at $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{y}$ respectively, and angle brackets denote
ensemble averaging.

Figure~\ref{fig:Coherence_staic} presents contours of $\gamma^2$ of sectional
transverse force for a static circular cylinder (aspect ratio, $L/D$=20)
simulation. Nondimensional frequency, $k = f\,D/V_\infty$ is used here to plot
coherence which is small everywhere except at the K\'arm\'an vortex-shedding
frequency, $f_v$. The Strouhal number, $St = f_v D/V_\infty$ is $\sim 0.2$.
Several studies (e.g.~\citet{labbe2007numerical}) have investigated the impact
of span length in simulations of flow over {\em stationary} cylinders.

In this paper, we investigate the effect of domain size when simulating VIV of
a circular cylinder with periodic boundaries in the span direction. While the
effect of finite span (aspect ratio or span length-to-diameter ratio, $L/D$) on
VIV has been investigated experimentally (e.g.,~\citet{szepessy1992aspect}),
such an investigation is lacking for simulations. Although
\citet{lucor2005vortex} analyzed spanwise correlation in their VIV simulations
of one cylinder with $L/D=26$, they did not investigate the impact of varying
$L/D$. We present detached eddy simualtion results of VIV of four models with
$L/D=1,~2,~5,$ and $10$. Displacement amplitude, oscillation frequency, lift
spectra, and spanwise coherence are compared between the simulations.

\section{Computational Methodology and Verification} 
\label{sec:methodology}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
A coupled fluid-solid dynamics solver is used to simulate an
elastically-mounted rigid circular cylinder experiencing VIV. A $k$-$\omega$
detached eddy simulation (DES) technique~\cite{yin2015dynamic} is used to model
the flow and a forced single degree of freedom mass-spring-damper system is
solved to model the dynamics of the cylinder. The details are provided in Wu
\etal \citep{wu2019}.

Figure~\ref{fig:VIV_verification} shows a schematic of the simulation setup and
comparisons with measured data from Ref.~\cite{khalak1997fluid} for a low
mass-damping cylinder undergoing VIV. The following nondimensional numbers are
matched between the experiment and the simulations: mass ratio, $m^*=2.6$,
mechanical damping ratio, $\zeta=0.001$, and reduced velocity, $V_R =
V_\infty/(f_N D)$, where $f_N$ is the natural frequency of the system. The flow
Reynolds number based on the cylinder diameter, $Re_D=2\times 10^4$. The same
values of $m^*$, $\zeta$, and $Re_D$ are used for all the simulations in the
paper.

The simulations accurately predict the displacement amplitude and the vortex
shedding frequency of the cylinder (see Fig.~\ref{fig:VIV_verification}) over a
wide range of $V_R$ which includes the four branches identified in
Ref.~\cite{khalak1997fluid}: {\em Initial Excitation}, {\em Upper}, {\em
Lower}, and {\em Desynchronization}. Of particular interest is the ``lock-in''
phenomenon which occurs in the {\em Upper} and {\em Lower} branches where the
chances of structural damage are highest.

\section{Effect of Aspect Ratio}
\label{sec:periodicity}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
Four cylinder models with aspect ratio, $L/D$ $= 1, 2, 5,$ and $10$ are
modeled. For each configuration, seven values of reduced velocity $V_{R}$
($=2, 3, 4, 5, 5.9, 7, 8$) are evaluated; this wide range of $V_R$ covers the
{\em Initial Excitation}, {\em Upper}, and {\em Lower} branches.
Figure~\ref{fig:span_amp_freq} compares the predicted scaled mean amplitude
($\bar{A}/D$) and the normalized oscillation frequency ($f_v/f_N$) for the
different models. The convergence of the results for models with $L/D=$ $5$ and
$10$ shows that span length of $10\, D$ is adequate for VIV simulations.
While the smaller-span models exhibit the same qualitative trend,
moderate-to-large differences are observed between them in the {\em Initial
Excitation} and {\em Upper} branches including underprediction of the peak
amplitude.

%------------------------%
\subsection{$V_R=5$}
\label{sec:vr_5}
%------------------------%
Peak amplitude is observed when $f_v$ matches $f_N$ (resonance condition). The
$k$ corresponding to $f_N$ is called $k_N$ ($= 1/V_R = 0.2$ for $V_R=5$). Power
spectral density (PSD) of the transverse aerodynamic force coefficient, $C_y =
2 F_y/(\rho V^2_\infty L)$ of the four models are compared in
Fig.~\ref{fig:RV_5} (a). A linear scale is used to plot the PSDs to accentuate
the differences. The spectral peak is higher and narrower for the models with
$L\ge5D$. For shorter-span models, the energy is distributed over a wider
frequency range, resulting in a broader peak. A sharp peak in $C_y$ at $k \sim
St$ results in greater excitation, hence higher $\bar{A}/D$, for the
larger-span models at $V_R=5$.

Spanwise coherence of transverse sectional force coefficient, $c_y(z) = 2
f_y(z)/(\rho V^2_\infty)$ are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:RV_5} (b) for $V_R=5$.
For the larger-span cylinders ($L\ge5D$), high coherence ($\gamma^2$) is
limited to a very small band of $k$ around $St$ ($\sim0.2$), whereas for the
smaller-span models, $\gamma^2$ is very high over the entire span for
$0.1<k<0.3$. High coherence at frequencies away from $k=St$ is the reason for
the broader but shorter peaks observed in the $C_y$ spectra 
%
%and consequently, a lower peak $\bar{A}/D$ is observed at $k=St$ 
%
for the smaller-span models.

\end{figure}

%------------------------%
\subsection{$V_R=5.9$}
\label{sec:vr_5p9}
%------------------------%
%
Smaller-span models underpredict $\bar{A}/D$ throughout the {\em Upper} branch.
The solutions at $V_R=5.9$ are probed to investigate this underprediction.
Figure~\ref{fig:RV_5p9} plots the $C_y$ spectra and the spanwise coherence of
$c_y$ for the different models. The $k$ corresponding to the natural frequency
is $k_N = 1/V_R \sim 0.17$ for $V_R=5.9$. The $C_y$ spectra for the small-span
models peak at $k \sim 0.2$ and ``lock-in'' with $k_N$ does not occur. The
spectrum of the largest-span model peaks around $k_N$; the peak is not exactly
at $k_N$ due to the added-mass effect, which can be substantial for low-$m^*$
systems. High coherence in the small-span models forces the vortex shedding at
$k\sim 0.2$ and does not allow ``lock-in'' at $k_N$.

  $\gamma^2(\Delta z,k)$ of $c_y$ for models with $L/D$=1,2,5,\&10.}
  \label{fig:RV_5p9}
\end{figure}

%------------------------%
\subsection{$V_R=3$}
\label{sec:vr_3}
%------------------------%
In contrast to underprediction in the ``lock-in'' region, the smaller-span
models overpredict $\bar{A}/D$ in the {\em Initial Excitation} branch. This is
consistent with the $C_y$ spectra which shows a higher peak at $k \sim 0.2$ for
the smaller-span models (see Fig.~\ref{fig:RV_3} (a)). Another peak is observed
with the smaller-span models at $k$ near $k_N$ ($\sim 0.33$ for $V_R=3$).
Figure~\ref{fig:RV_3} (b) shows increased coherence at $k_N$. The periodicity
in smaller span models reinforces the excitation at this frequency leading to
the additional peak in the $C_y$ spectra. In fact, the smallest-span model
oscillates at this frequency (see Fig.~\ref{fig:span_amp_freq} (b)), suggesting
a ``lock-in'' in the {\em Initial Excitation} branch.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
DES of VIV of an elastically-mounted rigid circular cylinder are performed with
periodic boundaries for four domains with span $L=1$-,$2$-,$5$-, and $10\,D$. The
results show that a minimum span of $5\,D$ is required to accurately predict
VIV. Simulations with smaller-span domains underpredict the peak displacement
amplitude and give erroneous predictions of the ``lock-in'' frequencies. High
spanwise coherence in these models at frequencies other than the
vortex-shedding frequency is responsible for the observed artefacts.
