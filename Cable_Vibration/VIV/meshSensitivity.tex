\subsection{Mesh Sensitivity Study}
\label{sec:mesh_sensitivity}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
A mesh sensitivity study is performed for the normally-incident flow category
for $Re_D=20,000$. Table~\ref{tab:meshSize} presents a summary of the different
cases simulated for this study.  Three different meshes, labeled `Mesh 1',
`Mesh 2', and `Mesh 3' are shown in the table.  The computational domain is
$25\times D$ in the radial direction and $10\times D$ in the span direction.

Figure~\ref{fig:Cp_compare_LS_Mesh} compares the mean aerodynamic pressure
coefficient, $\overline{C}_p=2 (\overline{p}-p_\infty)/(\rho V_\infty^2)$
obtained using simulations with different grids, and experimental data.
Experiment I refers to data from~\cite{norberg2013pressure} and Exp-ISU is from
our measurements. Simulations are simulated at `cylinder diameter based'
Reynolds number, $Re_D=20,000$, which is the same as Experiment I, but the
$Re_D$ in Exp-ISU is higher ($Re_D=51,500$) due to the limitation of the wind
tunnel and measurement equipment.

Consistent with the results of~\cite{travin2000detached}
and~\cite{breuer2000challenging}, the simulation results are found to be
sensitive to mesh size even with the highest mesh resolution attempted. Mesh 2
and Mesh 3 capture the flow separation location correctly (same as in the
experiment), but separation is delayed with Mesh 1. Results of Mesh 2 are in
closer agreement with Experiment I, however they differ from the results of
Mesh 3 in the separated flow region. Interestingly, the Exp-ISU data agrees
well with Mesh 3 results in the same region. Based on this study, Mesh 2 is
chosen for the subsequent simulations because it can predict aerodynamic
loading and resolve wake turbulence reasonably accurately within a reasonable
computational cost.

\subsection{Static Cylinder with Normally-Incident Flow}
\label{sec:normally_incident}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
Table~\ref{tab:comparisonRe20k} summarizes the simulation results for the
static case and compares them with two sets of experimental data. The peak
shedding Strouhal number ($St_p$), the mean drag coefficient, $\overline{C}_d$
and the mean back pressure coefficient, $\overline{C}_{pb}$ are compared in the
table. Strouhal number is a non-dimensional frequency, defined here as $St =
f\,D/V_\infty$, and $St_p$ corresponds to the peak vortex shedding frequency of
the cylinder.

Figure~\ref{fig:Cp_compared_Re20k} compares the predicted mean aerodynamic
pressure coefficient, $\overline{C}_p$ and the root mean square of perturbation
pressure coefficient, $C_{p'rms} = \left(\,\overline{C^2_p -
\overline{C}^2_p}\,\right)^{1/2}$ with the data from the two experiments. The
predicted $\overline{C}_p$ agrees very well with the data from Experiment I;
Exp-ISU data shows slightly lower $\overline{C}_p$ than observed in
Experiment I and the simulation, especially after $100^\circ$, and the mean
back pressure, $\overline{C}_{pb}$ is lower as well. The prediction
$C_{p'rms}$ distribution lies in between the two measurements. Both
measurements as well as the simulation show the peak to be around $80^\circ$,
which indicates the location of flow separation. The predicted distribution
over the cylinder surface agrees well with the measurements.

Figure~\ref{fig:velocity_Normal_Re20k} plots the predicted and measured wake
velocity profiles at the axial station, $x/D=2$; the cylinder axis is located
at $x/D=0$. The peak wake deficit and the wake profile are predicted
accurately. The measured data shows a slight asymmetry in the data, which is
perhaps due to asymmetry in the experimental setup (e.g., distance from the
tunnel wall between the top and bottom surfaces of the cylinder). The
simulation data is averaged over 120 wake shedding cycles and experimental data
is averaged over 540 cycles.

Figure~\ref{fig:force_20k} presents predicted temporal variation of sectional
lift and drag coefficients ($C_l$ and $C_d$). As expected for a circular
cylinder, the mean lift coefficient ($\overline{C}_l$) is zero but the mean
drag coefficient ($\overline{C}_d$) is finite. The high-frequency oscillations,
more apparent in $C_l$ time history are due to Karman vortex shedding, which
occurs at $St=fd/U \sim 0.2$ for bluff bodies in the range of $Re_D$ considered
here. In addition to the oscillations at the Karman vortex shedding frequency,
the entire signal appears to modulate at a frequency which is an order of
magnitude lower than that corresponding to $St=0.2$. This modulation has a
certain randomness to it and is not perfectly periodic. This modulation
phenomenon has been reported elsewhere, see e.g.,~\cite{travin2000detached}.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:St_Compared_Re20k} (a) compares the power spectral densities of
lift coefficient ($C_l$) between data from Exp-ISU and the simulation. 
The lift in the measurements is obtained by integrating the surface
pressure measured using the pressure taps. Figure~\ref{fig:St_Compared_Re20k} (b)
presents the DES computed spectra of $C_d$.  Because vortex shedding alternates
between the top and bottom sides of the cylinder, one vortex shedding period contains two cycles
of drag but only one cycle of lift. This can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:St_Compared_Re20k}, where the spectral peak for $C_l$ occurs at
$f_p$ while the spectral peak for drag is at $2\times f_p$, where $f_p$ is determined
by the peak shedding Strouhal number, $St_p = f_p\,D/V_\infty$. Based on existing
literature (see~\cite{travin2000detached} and~\cite{norberg2013pressure}),
$St_p \sim 0.2$. Both measurement and prediction agree very well with each
other and show the peak for lift to be around $f_p$ corresponding to $St_p$.

\end{figure}

The peak frequency and its first three harmonics that occur at $St = 0.4, 0.6,
\& \,0.8$, are identified in the figure using vertical grid lines and labeled
as $2f_p,\,3f_p,\,\&\,4f_p$. The prediction and experiment both show a second,
smaller peak in the lift spectrum at the third harmonic ($St=0.6$).  Since the
lift vector alternates with the side the vortex sheds from, only odd harmonics
of $f_p$ (i.e., $3f_p,~5f_p,\ldots$) are expected in the spectra. Therefore, no
peak is observed in the lift spectra at the second harmonic ($St=0.4$) or
higher {\em even} harmonics in either the measured or the simulated data. The
spectral shape of the PSD of $C_l$ is correctly predicted, even though the
magnitude is slightly higher than the measured data.

\subsection{Static Cylinder with Yawed Flow (Inclined Cylinder)}
\label{sec:inclined_cylinder}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
Figure~\ref{fig:yawedModel} is a schematic that illustrates the setup for the
inclined-cylinder simulations. The relative inclination of the cylinder axis
with respect to the flow is obtained by yawing the flow rather than inclining
the cylinder; these simulations are therefore also referred to as yawed flow
simulations. Other than yawing the inflow, the setup is exactly the same as for
the normally-incident flow cases.

The yaw angle, $\beta$ is defined as the angle between the inflow velocity
vector $\boldsymbol{V_\infty}$ and the $x$ axis; the cylinder is aligned with
the $z$ axis. The normal component of the flow velocity, $V_n$ and the spanwise
component, $V_z$ are defined as $V_n=V_\infty \cos\,\beta$ and $V_z = V_\infty
\,\sin\,\beta$, where $V_\infty=\abs{\boldsymbol{V_\infty}}$. The computational
domain is $10\times D$ in the spanwise direction to resolve and investigate 
spanwise variation of aerodynamic forces.
Three different yaw angles $\beta=15,\,30,\,\&\,45$ degrees are investigated
in these simulations.
%
\begin{figure}[htb!]
  \incfig[width=0.6\textwidth]{Figures/yawedModel.png}
  \caption{A schematic of the computational setup for static inclined cylinder
    simulations. The right figure is a cross-sectional view.  The inflow is set
    to an angle with respect to the cylinder axis, which stays aligned with the $z$
    axis of the coordinate system.}
  \label{fig:yawedModel}
\end{figure}


Table~\ref{tab:comparisonYawedRe20k} summarizes the peak Strouhal number
($St_p$) and the back pressure coefficient ($C_{pb}$) for four different flow
yaw angles, $\beta=0,15,30,\,\&\,45$ degrees. 
The component of the freestream velocity normal to the cylinder axis is used as the reference
velocity scale to define a new set of non-dimensional quantities, such as
Reynolds number, $Re_{D,n} = \rho V_n D / \mu$, Strouhal number, $St_{p,n}=f\,D
/V_n$, and aerodynamic pressure coefficient, $\overline{C}_{p,n}=2
(\overline{p}-p_\infty)/(\rho V_n^2)$. The peak shedding Strouhal number and
the mean back pressure coefficient normalized in this manner are labeled
respectively as $St_{p,n}$ and $\overline{C}_{pb,n}$. The measured value of
$\overline{C}_{pb,n}$ is lower than predicted by the simulations (see
Table~\ref{tab:comparisonYawedRe20k}), suggesting that the measured mean
velocity at the back of the cylinder is slightly higher than predicted.

Figure~\ref{fig:Cp_Compared_Yawed_Exp-ISU} compares with measured data the
predicted mean aerodynamic pressure coefficient ($\overline{C}_{p,n}$) and root
mean square of perturbation pressure coefficient, $C_{p'rms,n}$ normalized
using $V_n$, for $\beta=30^\circ$ case. The predicted distribution of
$\overline{C}_{p,n}$ and mean back pressure, $\overline{C}_{pb,n}$ are found to be
slightly higher than Exp-ISU data, which is consisted with the observation for
the normally-incident flow cases. The predicted $C_{p'rms,n}$ distribution
agrees very well with measurement, especially before $120^\circ$. The peak of
$C_{p'rms,n}$ is observed around $80^\circ$ in both experiment and simulation,
which is indicative of the location of separation of the shear layer. Beyond
$\theta=120^\circ$, the measured data shows higher $C_{p'rms,n}$ than
predicted by the simulations. A similar underprediction is observed in the
normally-incident flow case.

Figure~\ref{fig:velocity_Yawed30_Re20k.png} presents predicted and measured
wake velocity profiles for $\beta=30^\circ$ case at $x/D=2$. The predicted peak
wake deficit matches remarkably well with Exp-ISU data. However, the
experimental data shows higher overshoots in streamwise velocity in the shear
layer region than predicted by the simulations. The experimental data is also
very slightly asymmetric, which is likely due to the fact that the cylinder is
located closer to one side of the tunnel wall. It should be noted that the
asymmetry is very small and the wall effects are minimal.

Figure~\ref{fig:St_Compared_Yawed30_Exp-ISU} compares the power spectral
densities of the transverse force coefficient (along the $y$ axis), $C_{y,n}$
for $\beta=30^\circ$ case between Exp-ISU data and predictions, where $C_{y,n}
= 2\, F_y/ \left( \rho V^2_n (D \times L) \right)$, $F_y$ is the net force over
the entire cylinder; longitudinal force coefficient, $C_{x,n}$ is similarly
defined. In the simulation, the first peak is observed around $St_{p,n}\sim
0.2$, which is the same as for the normally-incidence flow case (see
Figure~\ref{fig:St_Compared_Re20k} (a)). The spectral shape is correctly
predicted by the simulation although the measured curve appears to be shifted
along the $x$ axis; this is likely due to a scaling factor in frequency (log
scale is used for frequency in Fig.~\ref{fig:St_Compared_Yawed30_Exp-ISU}),
arising perhaps from a slight mismatch in the measurement of the inflow
velocity in the experiment.

Figure~\ref{fig:Compared_Yawed_Re20k} compares the predicted mean aerodynamic
pressure coefficient ($\overline{C}_{p,n}$) normalized using $V_n$, for four
different values of inflow yaw angle, $\beta$. The distribution of
$\overline{C}_{p,n}$ is found to be very similar irrespective of
$\beta$;~\cite{zdravkovich2003flow} refers to this as `independence principle'.
The independence principle is also observed in the power spectral densities of
the transverse force coefficient, $C_{y,n}$ for the same set of values of $\beta$
analyzed. Figure~\ref{fig:Compared_Yawed_Re20k} (b) shows that the spectra
collapse when $V_n$ is used to normalize the force coefficients and the frequency;
the abscissa in Fig.~\ref{fig:Compared_Yawed_Re20k} (b) is $St_n$.

Figure~\ref{fig:Spatial_temporal_CxCyRe20k} shows spatio-temporal plots of the
the force coefficients $C_{x,n}$ and $C_{y,n}$. Here, $C_{x,n}$ and $C_{y,n}$
are functions of spanwise location and are computed by normalizing the
sectional forces in $x$ and $y$ directions respectively ($C_{x,n} = 2\, f_x/
(\rho V^2_n)$, where $f_x$ is force per unit area in the $x$
direction). The coefficients are plotted as functions of span ($z$) and time to
obtain the contours shown in the figure. The contours clearly show that the
force coefficients vary along the span, indicating that vortex shedding does
not occur simultaneously along the entire span. In fact, a spatial drift from
left to right with increasing time can be seen in the contours (more visible in
the $C_{x,n}$ spatio-temporal plot) which is indicative of spanwise flow over
the cylinder.

Figure~\ref{fig:Coherence_Yawed30_Re20k} presents coherence of force

$\gamma^2(\Delta z)$ is defined as
%
\begin{align}
  \gamma^2(\Delta z) &= \frac{\langle \abs{S_{xy}}^2 \rangle}{\langle
    S_{xx}\rangle \langle S_{yy} \rangle},
  \label{eq:coherence}

%
where $S_{xy}$ denotes cross-spectral density of the quantity ($C_{x,n}$ or
$C_{y,n}$) at two points separated by a distance $\Delta z$, and
$S_{xx},~S_{yy}$ are auto-spectral densities; angular brackets denote ensemble
averaging, however ergodicity assumption is used to relate that to time
averaging. The coherence plot of $C_{y,n}$ indicates that spanwise correlation
is very high (over nearly the entire cylinder span) at the vortex shedding
frequency, but is small at other frequencies, which is expected based on
literature. $C_{x,n}$ however is not that highly correlated along the span even
at the peak vortex shedding frequency.
