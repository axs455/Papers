\begin{abstract}
A computational approach based on a $k$-$\omega$ delayed detached eddy simulation
model for predicting aerodynamic loads on a smooth circular cylinder is
verified against experiments. Comparisons with experiments are performed for
flow over a rigidly-mounted (static) cylinder and for an elastically-mounted
rigid cylinder oscillating in the transverse direction due to vortex-induced
vibration (VIV). For the static cases, measurement data from the literature is
used to validate the predictions for normally-incident flow.  New experiments
are conducted as a part of this study for yawed flow, where the cylinder axis
is inclined with respect to the inflow velocity at the desired yaw angle,
$\beta=30^\circ$. Good agreement is observed between the predictions and
measurements for mean and rms surface pressure.  Three yawed flow cases
($\beta=15^\circ, 30^\circ, \,\&\, 45^\circ$) are simulated and the results are
found to be independent of $\beta$ (independence principle) when the flow speed
normal to the cylinder axis is selected as the reference velocity scale.

Dynamic (VIV) simulations for an elastically-mounted rigid cylinder are
performed by coupling the flow solver with a solid dynamics solver where the
cylinder motion is modeled as a mass-spring-damper system. The simulations
accurately predict the displacement amplitude and unsteady loading over a wide
range of reduced velocity, including the region where ``lock-in''
(synchronization) occurs. VIV simulations are performed at two yaw angles,
$\beta=0^\circ$ and $45^\circ$ and the independence principle is found to be
valid over the range of reduced velocities tested with a slightly higher
discrepancy when the vortex shedding frequency is close to the natural
frequency of the system.

%
A computational methodology based on a $k$-$\omega$ delayed detached eddy
simulation (DDES) model is used to investigate aerodynamic loading on a smooth
circular cylinder. Simulations are performed for a static and an
elastically-mounted rigid cylinder in normally-incident flow and yawed flow.
For static-cylinder configuration, the computational methodology is verified
against experimental data in normally-incident flow ($\beta=0^\circ$) and yawed
flow ($\beta=30^\circ$). The agreement between the simulations and the
experiments for normally-incident flow is very good, and the results of the
yawed flow simulations are in reasonable agreement with the measurements.
These favorable comparisons demonstrate the ability of the DES methodology to
accurately predict aerodynamic loading on static circular cylinders. Simulation
results for different flow angles ($\beta =0^\circ, 15^\circ,
30^\circ,~\&~45^\circ$) also verify the validity of the independence principle
for $\beta$ up to $45^\circ$.

For the elastically-mounted rigid cylinder (vortex-induced vibration)
simulations, the dynamics of the cylinder is modeled using a forced
mass-spring-damper system with a low mass ratio and low damping, and the
cylinder is constrained to move only in the transverse direction.  The
simulation results are compared with two sets of existing experimental data and
the agreement of the predicted displacement amplitude and vortex shedding
frequency with the measurements is found to be good over a wide range of
reduced velocity. The frequency lock-in phenomenon is captured by the
simulations. Different modes of vortex shedding (2S and 2P) are observed in the
simulations and are identified through visualization of the iso-surfaces of the
Q-criterion. Results for two values of $\beta$ ($=0^\circ$ and $45^\circ$) are
compared and, barring some difference in the regions where the displacement
amplitude is highly sensitive to the reduced velocity, the independence
principle is found to hold for circular cylinders in VIV up to a yaw angle of
$45^\circ$.
